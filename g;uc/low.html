        <p>👉🏻Hypoglycemia is common in people with diabetes, especially people who take insulin to manage the condition. <br>

            👉🏻Common causes of diabetic hypoglycemia include: Taking too much insulin or diabetes medication. Not eating enough. <br>
            
            👉🏻You can experience hypoglycemia without having diabetes, but it’s uncommon. <br>
            👉🏻The plan helps you control blood sugar, manage your weight and control heart disease risk factors, such as low blood pressure. <br>
            👉🏻 sugary foods or drinks without protein or fat that are easily converted to sugar in the body. Try glucose tablets or gel, fruit juice, regular (not diet) soda, honey, or sugary candy.

        <p>The target is to engage in 150 minutes or more of moderate-intensity exercise each week. Attempting to squeeze in at least 20 to 25 minutes of exercise each day is one method to achieve this. Additionally, incorporate exercises that target all main muscle groups on two or more days each week (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms). <br> <br>
            The following are some examples of moderate-intensity exercises: <br> <br>
            ➡️ Walking briskly <br>
➡️ Doing housework <br>
➡️ Mowing the lawn <br>
➡️ Dancing <br>
➡️ Swimming <br>
➡️ Bicycling <br>
➡️ Playing Sports <br>
